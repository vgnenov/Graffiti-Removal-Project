## Background 

  

Each day someone in Chicago makes a call to 311 to report a graffiti that needs to be removed. The City of Chicago is doing a very good job to keep track of these graffiti and to removed them, some in a manner of days. Our project explores the data from 311 Service Requests - Graffiti Removal. The data set included with the assignment is found here : https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests-Graffiti-Removal-Historical/hec5-y4x5/data. 

The goal of this project is to explore the data, observe trends, and tell a story through data visualization. 

  

### Requirements 

1. Our project includes a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL database. 

2. Pandas was used to scrap, clean, and push the data to a SQL database. 

3. Our project contains: 

  

### 3.1. A dynamic line graph that displays the number and the date of graffiti removal requests. 

This graph was created using D3.js library.

Table was created using HTML/CSS.
